Introduction

     These are some scripts to make KMZ files for use with google earth
     All scripte use the file named Mech.list which is created for each moment tensor in the
     HTML.REG directory as mechlist.proto
     
     As I do moment tensor, I essentially do a
	     cat DATETIME/HTML.REG/mechlist.proto >> Mech.list
     The attached Mech.list is what I currently have for Europe
     
     The scripts work by creating one kml file for all events  and an image for each event. 
     These are then zip'ed together using the program 'zip'

Format of Mech.list

     This Mech.list is hased on what I created for Italy  abnd then extended for Europe.
     The lines are
     
     20081001_224737  42.590   13.287 15.0 3.20 320  75  -90 0.5305
     20081223_152421  44.544   10.345 22.0 5.21  95  55   80 0.7429

     and this is what I have for the North America RMT's

     There are 9 fields for Europe and 11 fields for NA.
     For Eurpe we have
     
     DATE_TIME LATITUDE LONGITUDE RMT_DEPTH MW STK DIP RAKE GOODNESS_OF_FIT
     
     for NA  we have
     
     DATE_TIME LATITUDE LONGITUDE RMT_DEPTH MW STK DIP RAKE RMT_DOCUMENTATION VELOCITY_MODEL RMT_SOURCE
     
     In bash scripts there is  the following
     
     cp Mech.list > m.list   # never mess around with the master data file
     while read YEARDATE LAT LON H MW STK DIP RAKE CITATION
     do
     ...
     done < m.list
     
     Thus I am interested only in the first 9 fields.

Basis of the script.  
     I believe I did an epicenter search on the NEIC page and got the output in KMZ, 
     and then realied the KMZ was a zip of KML files, which I then looked at. 
     There were not ChatBots at the time.

     The scripts use the programs 'zip' and the ImageMagick 'convert'. The latter is used
     to convert the EPS files from GMT to PNG for the web.

     The scripts do the following
        1.  define a unique name for the KMZ file, e.g., eumech
        2.  create a KML file by

            cat head body tail > eumech.kml

	3a. the head has a title and an initial view when the KMZ is opened. Here I set it to
            40N 10E (sardinia onece belonged to Barcelona)

        3b. body     For each event I use GMT psmeca to make a beachball plot. I also create the
            information that appears when you click on the beach ball.

            You can comment out some lines, e.g., the one for CITATION and the one for
	    web site.
        3c. tail  - this just completes the KML

SCRIPTS:

     DOALLFM4  - beachball plot using GMT4 which is what I have on my older machines
     DOALLFM5  - beachball plot using GMT5+
		I was able to test this script since I have a very new Linux system 
		running under VirtualBox (goo old Intel) which has GMT 6.3.0

		These scripts take a long time to run for my NA RMT's since
		I generate the beachballs for each event for each update of the KMZ. This
		take a while, but makes the logic a bit simpler.

		For your events, or ev en if you try to plot all IGN's solutions,
		it will not take much time since  there may not be as many.

		These scripts have many comment lines

     DOCAXIS4   GMT plot directin of maximum compressive stress axis colored
     EOCAXIS5   by type of faulting. There are GMT4 and GMT5+ versions
