The main differences/features of these scripts with respect to the original ones are: Instead of having a copy of all the scripts inside each event directory now there is only one version of the scripts that works for all events. Processing parameters are stored in a single parameter file that can be adjusted for each event. Event hypocenter and origin time are read from a location file that is stored at the top level of the event directory The scripts are writen in bash shell, instead of the Bourne shell ( sh ) as the original one. This means that more powerful features can be used (for example conditionals using [[ ]] , etc cetera). The basic processing now consists of 4 steps. Creating the event directories containing a location and a parameter file Data extraction Data selection/QC Inversion This can be accomplished running the following scripts: $ rcmt_dataselect.sh location_file parameter_file # extracts data from an SDS $ rcm_qc.sh # requires input from user $ rcmt_solution.sh # runs grid search for best solution","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"scripts/intro/#introduction","text":"The scripts in this repository are a re-write of Herrmann's original scripts.
